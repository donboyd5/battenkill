# Introduction

Different types of aquatic insects tolerate different stream conditions and levels of pollution. Their presence or absence, and quantity, can indicate clean or polluted water.

This document analyzes data on **benthic macroinvertebrates**, also known as bottom-dwelling aquatic insects:

-   **benthic**: bottom dwelling

-   **macro:** large enough to be seen with the naked eye

-   **invertebrate:** an animal without a backbone

One method researchers use to assess the quality of water in marine and freshwater ecosystems is to gather representative samples of macroinvertibrates in a stream environment and construct measures, known as **biotic indexes,** that indicate the types and abundance of organisms present.
