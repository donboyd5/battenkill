This document analyzes data on aquatic insects in the Battenkill River, based on two Excel files provided by Jacob Fetterman:

-   New York data sampled between October 1984 and August 2016 (2020.04.24_NYS DEC RIBS Sampling Data.xlsx)

-   Vermont data sampled between October 1986 and September 2019 (2020.05.04_VFWD IWIS Sampling Data.xlsx)

I adjusted for several anomalies in the data (e.g., miscoded latitude and longitude) and added several identification variables to the data.

The data-cleaning appendix discusses these adjustments.
