# Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (the EPT Index)

The EPT Index is named for three orders of aquatic insects that are common in the benthic (bottom dwelling) macroinvertebrate community:

-   Ephemeroptera (mayflies)

-   Plecoptera (stoneflies), and

-   Trichoptera (caddisflies).

The EPT Index is based on the premise that high-quality streams usually have the greatest species richness. Many aquatic insect species are intolerant of pollutants and will not be found in polluted waters. **The greater the pollution, the lower the species richness expected, as only a few species are pollutant tolerant.** [@mcquaidEPTIndex2012]
