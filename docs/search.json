All of the observations in the data were in this range except for one.\nThe observation at site id 502390, Lye Brook Confluence, on 1990-09-28 was 26.5. Other observations near Lye Brook in the same time period (1990-1995) ranged between 1.44 and 1.92. Based on this, I assumed this was a typo, probably with the decimal in the wrong place, so I divided it by 10 giving 2.65. However, I flagged the observation as potentially bad, so that we can drop it instead of altering, if desired."

Tolerance values, listed in Appendix 17.11, are mostly from Hilsenhoff (1987) however some have been recalibrated based on NYS datasets. High HBI values are indicative of organic (sewage) pollution, while low values indicate lack of sewage effects. (NY doc)"
